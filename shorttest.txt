When working with large files, it can be challenging to process them efficiently due to their size. In such cases, it can be helpful to split the file into smaller chunks and process each chunk separately. This is where the Python code we’re about to discuss comes into play.

The Python code we’re looking at is designed to split a large file into smaller files using multiple threads. It’s a well-designed code that effectively utilizes threading to split the file in parallel, which significantly reduces the processing time.

Before we dive into the code, let’s understand some key concepts that are essential to understanding the code.

Threading: In Python, a thread is a separate flow of execution that runs concurrently with the main program. Each thread can execute a separate task independently, which allows the program to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.
Input and Output: The code takes an input file path, which is the path to the large file that needs to be split. It also takes an output directory path, which is the path to the directory where the smaller files will be stored.
Chunking: The code splits the input file into smaller chunks, where each chunk is a subset of the original file. The number of chunks is determined by the number of threads defined in the code.
